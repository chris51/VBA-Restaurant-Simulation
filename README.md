VBA Restaurant Simulation

A detailed restaurant simulation in VBA.

The goal is to teach high school level student the basics of menu planning, pricing and inventory management.  They will also learn how to read accounting statements (
P&L, balance sheet and cashflow).

I am looking for any help making the simulation better.  More professional, better coding, and any improvment suggeestions. 

Untimely, I would like to reqwrite the app in javascript or another language for use on the internet and phone.
