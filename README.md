VBA Restaurant Simulation

A basic restaurant simulation in VBA.

The goal is to teach high school level student the basics of menu planning, pricing and read accounting statements (
P&L, balance sheet and cashflow).

I am looking for any help making the simulation better.  More professional, better coding, and any improvment suggeestions.
